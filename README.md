## Configuration

There is a config file "config.cfg". The gamefolder should be detected automatically, if it does not - specify the path manualy.
It is also possible to set the language. By default it is set to en_US, but it can be set to any of the languages you have in your BG2\lang folder.

Also, if you are to right-click the Radar at the top left corner it would show a proper **Options window**
